This project was a pleasure to work on and allowed us to explore various polygons and rare geometric shapes for the web. This was designed for ease-of-use while maintaining a beautiful aesthetic that earned us two design awards. The first was an honorable mention from <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/best-websites/your-leadership-edge-a-klc-experience-1/">Awwwards</a>, the second was from <a href="http://gdusa.com/uncategorized/2015-american-web-design-awards-winner?eid=6676">Graphic Design USA</a> (which earned us a spot in their annual issue), and the third was a <a href="https://www.w3award.com/">W3 Award</a>.
