In collaboration with <a href="http://www.centresource.com/">Centresource</a>, we worked with Tony Robbin&#39;s team of experts to reimagine his brand and adapt it for a new, younger generation. This revamp touched all corners of his digital identity but focused primarily on his digital presence and presentation. The end products turned out sleek and beautiful â€“ we are biting our nails in ambition of it&#39;s launch in 2016.
