quote: "Our company has officially changed its name from Risk I/O to Kenna. Why the change? The name “Kenna” is a play on the Middle English verb “to ken,” or “to know.” And that’s what we strive to give our customers—the ability to know what to prioritize and remediate, as well as a way to understand their full risk landscape. Kenna stands for knowledgeand confidence. (Karim Toubba, Kenna Security)"

<a href="https://www.kennasecurity.com/">Risk I/O</a> is a data security software that protects your web technology from malicious activity. On this project (in partnership with <a href="https://www.mojotech.com/">MojoTech</a>), our responsibilities were primarily focused on marketing - both web and print. We worked to craft a brand and experience on the web. It then gained traction and we were tasked with creating material and environments for them to display at conventions and to potential customers.
