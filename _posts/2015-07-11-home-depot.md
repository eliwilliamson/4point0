During our time at <a href="http://www.wdpartners.com/">WD Partners</a>, we worked closely with <a href="http://bonfirered.com/">Bonfire Red</a> to craft a digital decision support tool for buyers. We worked on three interactive prototypes - Faucets, Lighting &amp; Fans, and (lawn care) Solutions. Through rapid prototyping in static mockups and interactive front-end-coded prototypes we were able to portray concepts in a realistic way. This ultimately lead to full development of the Apps and can be seen in Home Depot stores nationwide.
