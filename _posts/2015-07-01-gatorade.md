quote: "The goal was to create a plug-and-play promotions framework as customizable as the products they sell. Once a promotion is strategized, designed and deployed, each would be graded on increased traffic to site and consumer engagement, increased email acquisition and increased product demand. (Chris Rinehart, Bonfire Red)"

During our time at <a href="http://www.wdpartners.com/">WD Partners</a>, we worked closely with <a href="http://bonfirered.com/">Bonfire Red</a> to create an interactive experience for a point of sale prototype. The folks at Gatorade were thrilled with the results and our attention to detail in the front-end coding of this prototype. This prototype helped us explore an additional iPad prototype.
