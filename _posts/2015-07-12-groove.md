quote: "We assigned a small team of engineers and a designer to get the project rolling. We worked with Alex to outline our strategy, and then got to work. Our goal was to launch an MVP within three months with a focus on clean and simple UX. We built a full-featured support platform that has everything small businesses need to offer awesome customer support—and nothing that they don’t. In fact, our MVP had 10% of the features the competitors were offering. We disregarded any feature that felt bloated, caused confusion, or lacked a purpose for everyday use. (Mojotech)"

We worked with MojoTech to iterate on multiple versions of Groove – a help desk app that makes customer support simple and easy to provide. During this project, we designed and developed multiple web & mobile marketing sites including the popular <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog">Groove blog</a>. In addition to these marketing tools, we executed a full user experience audit and optimized flows as well as usability via a complete revamp of visual and interactive design.
