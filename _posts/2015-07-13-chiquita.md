We worked with <a href="http://www.wdpartners.com/">WD Partners</a> to photograph <a href="http://www.chiquita.com/Home.aspx">Chiquita's</a> site photography as well as create modular interactive experiences on the site. We assisted in the site's curated photoshoot and 'behind-the-scenes' documentation. We worked hand in hand to brainstorm, design, and revise the site’s aesthetic. It was built in the Kentico CMS and went on to win the <a href="http://www.kentico.com/customers/site-of-the-year/site-of-the-year-2011">Kentico Site of the Year</a>.
